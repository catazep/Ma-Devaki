      "P1": "Swami Atmananda Udasin is the Headmonk under whose guidance the Ajatananda Ashram community in Rishikesh, India operates – an interreligious monastic ashram dedicated to the Unity of Truth, designed to support spiritual seekers from all religious traditions.",
      "P2": "Swami Atmananda is part of the Advaita Vedanta tradition and teaches the Direct Path of Non-Duality, regularly offering satsangs and retreats both in India and abroad.",
      "P3": "Before embracing monastic life, Swami Atmananda worked as a university lecturer. Later, he spent a decade in solitude, first in a hermitage near Jerusalem and then in northern India, dedicating himself to deep spiritual practice. Towards the end of this period of retreat, he embraced Sanatana Dharma and, in 2001, received initiation into sannyasa (monastic renunciation) from his beloved spiritual Master, H.H. Sri Chandra Swami Udasin. His teachings continue to inspire seekers from around the world, guiding them towards Self-realization and inner peace."
