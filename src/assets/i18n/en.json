        "P2": "Born on December 1, 1918, Yogi Ramsuratkumar was a hidden saint who lived as a beggar on the streets of Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. In his quest for a Guru and Truth, he traveled through South India, where he met his three Gurus: Sri Aurobindo, Ramana Maharishi, and Papa Ramdas. The living spiritual Master - Papa Ramdas initiated him into the mantra 'Om Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram' and told him: 'Go and repeat day and night, all twenty-four hours.' Within seven days and seven nights, Ramsuratkumar made the great exodus from the Kingdom of man to the Kingdom of God. Ramsuratkumar became YOGI RAMSURATKUMAR, a savior of ignorant souls with a mission greater than his own liberation. Today, His Name, YOGI RAMSURATKUMAR, offers help, guidance, and protection to all who chant it and is a sanctuary of peace, love, and joy.",
